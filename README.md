ConvexHullApp
=============

Summary
----------------
This is a Java Swing application that can simulate computing of convex hulls.

- Can create random points, uniformly distributed on the rectangle
  - working on creating points within a ellipse

- Can support users putting their own points via click

> Algorithms:
  
  - Divide and conquer ()
  
  - Graham Scan (x)
  
  - Jarvis march (x)
  
  - Monotone Chain (x)
  
  - Quickhull ()
  
  - Randomized Incremental ()
  
  - Sweephull(x) - still buggy, but works for the most part,

FAQ
----------------

- How to contribute and work on this project?

  This was worked on with Eclipse IDE. You can easily add this project and its src code after making a project under eclipse.   You can import the project if you select this repo folder as the project's root directory.

- What is the purpose of this project?

  To provide a learning experience for students interested in Computational Geometry which is a growing field. Also Convex Hull algorithms are so cool, so I decided to make this application.
  
- Will there be expansions for other topics in CG?

  I am contemplating on adding algorithms for triangulations, but not just yet.
