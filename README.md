ConvexHullApp
=============

Java swing app to compute convex hulls.

-Can create random points, uniformly distributed on the rectangle
  - working on creating points within a ellipse

-Can support users putting their own points via click

-Algorithms:

>Jarvis march (x)

>Randomized Incremental ()

>Quickhull ()

>Divide and conquer ()

>Monotone Chain (x)

>Sweephull(x) - still buggy, but works for the most part,

FAQ
----------------

- How to contribute and work on this project?

  This was worked on with Eclipse IDE. You can easily add this project and its src code after making a project under eclipse.   You can import the project if you select this repo folder as the project's root directory.

- What is the purpose of this project?

  To provide a learning experience for students interested in Computational Geometry which is a growing field. Also Convex Hull algorithms are so cool, so I decided to make this application.
  
- Will there be expansions for other topics in CG?

  I am contemplating on adding algorithms for triangulations, but not just yet.
