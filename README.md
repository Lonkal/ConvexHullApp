=============

Java swing app to compute convex hulls.

-Can create random points, uniformly distributed on the rectangle
  - working on creating points within a ellipse

-Can support users putting their own points via click

-Algorithms:

>Jarvis march (x)

>Randomized Incremental ()

>Quickhull ()

>Divide and conquer ()

>Monotone Chain (x)

>Sweephull(x) - still buggy, but works for the most part,
